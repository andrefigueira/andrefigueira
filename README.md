When I'm not solving complex engineering challenges, you'll find me shredding on my guitar, producing beats in my home studio, or spending quality time with my wife and daughter. If not there, I’m likely on the golf course refining my game—I’m a low-handicap golfer who thrives on mastering hard things. This drive for mastery follows me in everything I do.
